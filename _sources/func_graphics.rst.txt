Graphics operations
===================

Draw graphical primitives into an image stored in an array.  The functions
``draw_xxx`` perform a similar operation to the functions ``plot_xxx`` 
from the `Spatial Math Toolbox <https://petercorke.github.io/spatialmath-python/func_2d_graphics.html>`_.
However the ``draw_xxx`` render the graphical primitive into the image pixel
array, whereas the ``plot_xxx`` use Matplotlib to render the graphical primitive
in a figure window.
