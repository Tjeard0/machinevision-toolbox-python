Image processing
================

The ``Image`` class is a core component of this Toolbox.  It encapsulates a
NumPy array that contains the pixel values of a greyscale or color image as
a 2D or 3D array respectively.
An ``Image`` instance has a very large number of methods that perform useful
operations on an image and wrap low-level operations performed using NumPy or
OpenCV.
